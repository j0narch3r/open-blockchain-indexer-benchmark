## Task 1: Monorepo scaffold, Makefile, CI

**Decided:** Used `uv` (0.8.17) with `[dependency-groups] dev = [...]` (PEP 735) in
`services/api/pyproject.toml` for dev-only dependencies (pytest, pytest-cov, ruff, mypy,
types-pyyaml), rather than `[project.optional-dependencies]`.
**Why:** This is `uv`'s current recommended mechanism for dev dependencies and keeps them out
of the published dependency metadata. No new third-party dependency was added by this choice.

**Decided:** `services/api/pyproject.toml` uses `hatchling` as the build backend
(`packages = ["contour"]`).
**Why:** Needed a PEP 517 backend so `uv sync` can install the `contour` package in editable
mode and `import contour` works from `services/api/tests/`. Hatchling is uv's documented
default recommendation and adds no extra runtime dependency (build-time only).

**Decided:** `make verify` runs, in order: `ruff check .`, `ruff format --check .`, `mypy .`,
`pytest`, each as its own `cd services/api && ...` recipe line.
**Why:** Matches the brief exactly (four checks). Running each as a separate line means `make`
aborts (non-zero exit) at the first failing check, giving a fast, unambiguous red signal — no
special error handling needed.

**Decided:** `make eval` is a no-op stub (prints "eval harness lands in Task 14", exits 0) and
is deliberately **not** invoked by `make verify`.
**Why:** Per task resolution — eval harness doesn't exist until Task 14; wiring it into verify
now would make `make verify` depend on unbuilt code. CLAUDE.md §9.1 already notes `make verify`
gains `make eval` "from Milestone 3 onward" — that wiring is a future task's job, not this one's.

**Decided:** `make data` and `make fixtures` are also stub targets in this task (they print an
informational message and exit 0) rather than shelling out to fixture/download scripts.
**Why:** The scripts they would call (`scripts/make_fixture_dem.py`, `scripts/fetch_3dep.py`,
etc.) don't exist yet — they're introduced in later tasks per the implementation plan's file
structure. Stubbing avoids inventing scope this task wasn't asked to build. `make dev` and
`make ship` are written for their eventual real commands (`uvicorn contour.api:app`, a deploy
step) even though they'll error today, since nothing exercises them as part of `make verify`.

**Decided:** `docker-compose.yml` declares `api` and `routing-engine` services with `build:`
contexts but no Dockerfiles exist yet in `services/api/` or `services/routing-engine/`.
**Why:** Task 1's file list doesn't include a Dockerfile, and per the environment notes,
docker compose is not executed in this task. The file documents the intended topology (per
SPEC §5.1) so later tasks extend a known shape instead of inventing a new one.

**Decided:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` lives at `contour/.github/workflows/ci.yml` (not the
repo root's `.github/`), with `defaults.run.working-directory: contour` so its `make verify`
step runs from the right place.
**Why:** Per the task's explicit resolution: the brief requires this path, even though GitHub
Actions only discovers workflows under the *repository* root's `.github/workflows/`. This means
the workflow will not actually run on GitHub as committed here — it is scaffolding for a
`contour`-rooted repo (e.g. once `contour/` is extracted to its own repo), not a functioning
CI trigger in the current monorepo layout. Flagged for whoever manages the eventual repo split.

**Decided:** `contour/.gitignore` (relative to `contour/`) ignores `data/**` except
`data/manifest.json` and `data/fixtures/**`, plus `.env`, `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`,
`node_modules/`, and `.superpowers/`, per the brief verbatim.
**Why:** As specified. Note `docs/superpowers/` (design doc + plan, already present) is a
different path and is **not** matched by the `.superpowers/` ignore pattern — it stays tracked,
per resolution to leave it alone.

**Alternatives rejected:** Wiring `make eval` into `make verify` now (rejected — eval harness
doesn't exist, would break the gate for every task before Task 14). Using `pip`/`venv` instead
of `uv` (rejected — task environment notes specify `uv`). Putting dev deps in
`[project.optional-dependencies]` (rejected — `uv`'s dependency-groups is the more current,
narrower-scoped mechanism and keeps dev tooling out of the installable package's metadata).
